# HCX Service Mesh

[Previous Challenge](./07-HCX-Compute-Profiles.md) - **[Home](../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge](./09-HCX-Network-Extension.md)

## Introduction

When HCX Migration, Disaster recovery, Network Extension, and WAN Optimization services are activated, HCX deploys Virtual Appliances in the source site and corresponding "peer" virtual appliances on the destination site. The Multi-Site Service Mesh activates the configuration, deployment, and serviceability of these Interconnect virtual appliance pairs.

## Challenge 

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

1.	Deploy a Service Mesh

As a part of this challenge you are also expected to <u>log on to the On Prem vCenter server and HCX Manager plugin in the On-Prem vCenter</u> to deploy the interconnect and network extension appliances as a part of Service Mesh

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. Incorrectly deploying the HCX may result in multiple forthcoming steps not operating as expected.

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server.

## Success Criteria

The service mesh between AVS and On-Prem is established.
