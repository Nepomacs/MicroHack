# **Azure VMware Solution - Micro Hack**

## MicroHack introduction and context

This hack is designed to get you hands-on experience with Azure VMWare Solution (AVS). This MicroHack is designed to be completed in a single day and is focused on the core concepts of AVS. 

AVS is a first-party Azure service that enables you to run your VMware workloads natively on Azure. AVS is a fully managed service from Microsoft that includes the VMware software-defined data center (SDDC) stack. This includes vSphere, vCenter, vSAN, NSX-T, and HCX. AVS is delivered on dedicated bare-metal Azure infrastructure that is not shared with other Azure services. AVS is a first-party Azure service that is owned, operated, and supported by Microsoft. 

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of AVs with a focus on the best practices and the design principles. It covers the basic hybrid backup and enables you to migrate workloads from on-premises to Azure.
